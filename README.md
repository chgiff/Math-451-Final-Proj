# Math 451 Final Proj
Final Project for Numerical Analysis class

The project does a reparameterization of a curve so the new curve has a constant arclength with respect to time.
ie. when moving a dot along a curve the dot will always go the same speed.

Numerical integration in this project is done via adaptive quadrature.
